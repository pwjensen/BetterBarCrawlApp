# Product Description
The Better Beer Crawlers app will use MST algorithms and GIS mapping data, which ensures users maximize both time and energy efficiency. 

This app will provide users with the availability to customize their bar crawl by selecting specific bars to visit, setting the number of stops, and adjusting the crawl radius. 

## Major Features
<ol>
<li>Route Optimization with MST Algorithm</li>
- The app will calculate the shortest route that visits all user-selected bars, ensuring efficient travel between locations.
<li>Customizable Bar Crawl</li>
- Users can specify the number of bars to visit, select specific bars, or set a distance radius to explore. 
<li>GIS Mapping and Directions</li>
- The app will integrate GIS technology to provide real-time mapping, directions, and an interactive map showing bar locations, user paths, and current location. 
<li></li>
</ol>

## Stretch Goals
<ol>
<li>BeReal-Inspired Feature</li>
- Adding the use of cameras on devices to take pictures/videos with both front-facing and rear-facing cameras to capture specific moments of the bar crawl.

# Use Cases

### Use Case 1:
Actors:
- **User**: a person planning to go out for a bar crawl with friends.

Triggers:
- The user decides to plan a night out with friends and wants to visit multiple bars in a specific area.

Preconditions:
- The user is logged into their account.

Postconditions:
- The app generates an optimal route for the user to visit all selected bars, providing walking distances. 

Steps:
<ol>
<li>The user opens the Beer Crawlers App.</li>
<li>The user selects the "Plan a Bar Crawl" feature.</li>
<li>The user inputs preferences, such as the number of bars and maximum distance.</li>
<li>The app displays a list of bars based on the user’s preferences.</li>
<li>The user selects the bars they want to visit.</li>
<li>The user taps on the "Get Route" button.</li>
<li>The app calculates and displays the optimal route using the MST algorithm.</li>
<li>The user reviews the route and details like walking distances and estimated time.</li>
<li>The user starts the bar crawl using the navigation feature.</li>
</ol>

Extensions of Success: 
- If the user decides to add or remove bars after viewing the route, they can do so by selecting new options and recalculating the route.

Exceptions:
- If the user tries to select more bars than are available in the area, the app will display a message indicating that the selection is too high and prompt the user to reduce the number of bars.

# Non-Functional Requirements

Describe at least three non-functional requirements, e.g., related to scalability, usability, security and privacy, etc.

<ol>
<li></li>
<li></li>
<li></li>
</ol>

# External Requirements
- The product must be robust against errors that can reasonably be expected to occur, such as invalid user input.

- The product must be installable by a user, or if the product is a web-based service, the server must have a public URL that others can use to access it. If the product is a stand-alone application, you are expected to provide a reasonable means for others to easily download, install, and run it.

- The software (all parts, including clients and servers) should be buildable from source by others. If your project is a web-based server, you will need to provide instructions for someone else setting up a new server. Your system should be well documented to enable new developers to make enhancements.

- The scope of the project must match the resources (number of team members) assigned.
  
Make sure that these requirements, if applicable to your product, are specialized to your project and included in your document—do not copy and paste these requirements verbatim. You may leave this as a separate section or fold its items into the other requirements sections.

# Team Process Description
## Software
- Specify and justify the software toolset you will use.

Django, React Native, NoSQL, ???

## Roles
- Define and justify each team member’s role: why does your team need this role filled, and why is a specific team member suited for this role?
