# Team Info & Policies
- List each team member and their role in the project.
- Link to each project relevant artifact such as your git repo (this can be empty for now).
- List communication channels/tools with corresponding use/communication policies (check main course page for communication channels and policies.)

# Product Description
- 4+ major features you will implement.
- 2+ stretch goals you hope to implement.

The major features should constitute a minimal viable product (MVP).

# Use Cases
Each team member must come up with and describe at least one use case of your product, following
  this template:
  <ol>
    <li>Actors</li>
    <li>Triggers</li>
    <li>Preconditions (success scenario)</li>
    <li>Postconditions (success scenario)</li>
    <li>List of steps</li>
    <li>Extensions/variations of the success scenario</li>
    <li>Exceptions: failure conditions and scenarios</li>
    <li>(At the end of this step you will have at least one use case per team member.)</li>
  </ol>

# Non-Functional Requirements

Describe at least three non-functional requirements, e.g., related to scalability, usability, security and privacy, etc.

# External Requirements
- The product must be robust against errors that can reasonably be expected to occur, such as invalid user input.

- The product must be installable by a user, or if the product is a web-based service, the server must have a public URL that others can use to access it. If the product is a stand-alone application, you are expected to provide a reasonable means for others to easily download, install, and run it.

- The software (all parts, including clients and servers) should be buildable from source by others. If your project is a web-based server, you will need to provide instructions for someone else setting up a new server. Your system should be well documented to enable new developers to make enhancements.

- The scope of the project must match the resources (number of team members) assigned.
  
Make sure that these requirements, if applicable to your product, are specialized to your project and included in your document—do not copy and paste these requirements verbatim. You may leave this as a separate section or fold its items into the other requirements sections.

# Team Process Description
- Specify and justify the software toolset you will use.

- Define and justify each team member’s role: why does your team need this role filled, and why is a specific team member suited for this role?

- Provide a schedule for each member (or sub-group) with at least four concrete milestones and deadlines for the semester.

- Specify and explain at least three major risks that could prevent you from completing your project.

- Describe at what point in your process external feedback (i.e., feedback from outside your project group, including the project manager) will be most useful and how you will get that feedback.
