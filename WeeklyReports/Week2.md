# Agenda

**Goals:**
- Coordinate with the team to review roles and assign tasks. 

**Progress Report:**
- **Tech Stack Discussion**: Continued researching potential front-end and back-end technologies. Flutter seems like the best option for this use case and time-span with pre-implemented solutions to our tasks problems.
- **Roles**: Discussed team roles and contributions. Solidified Back-End and Front-End members
- **Issues**: Determining the most suitable GIS integration approach and front-end technology (Kotlin vs. React Native vs. Flutter). Again, Flutter is likely the best option and using Google's implementation in their own Dart Language.


**Plans for next week:**
- Schedule regular meetings for collaboration.
- Refine the back-end architecture with a focus on database design and API structure.
- Get initial home page setup for testing.

**Questions:**
