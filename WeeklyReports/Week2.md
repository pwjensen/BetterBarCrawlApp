Each status report must be a ***markdown file*** and must include the following ***two sections***:

Team report (status update for your prof, including an agenda for the project meeting).
Contributions of individual team members.
Both sections should have the following three subsections -- each about a paragraph or organized as bullet points.

- The first subsection is easy. It should be an exact copy of the third section from last week (i.e., goals from a week ago). It can be empty for the first week.
- The second subsection should report on progress and issues: what you did, what worked, what you learned, where you had trouble, and where you are stuck.
- The third subsection should outline your plans and goals for the following week. Bullet points are fine. If tasks from one week aren't yet complete, they should roll over into tasks for the next week, with an updated estimate for time to completion.

For the team report, this subsection should be higher-level and indicate who is responsible for what tasks. Also, it's good to include longer-term goals in this list as well, to keep the bigger picture in mind and plan beyond just the next week.

###Weekly team meetings
Your team will meet at least once a week to discuss progress and issues, and/or work together. We have reserved Friday sections for this purpose. You can meet via Zoom, Teams, or any other conferencing system.

Successful teams often meet more than once per week and collaboratively write notes and define concrete action items.

###Weekly project meetings
You will meet with Nate for ~10 minutes during section on Friday (or at another mutually agreed time during Nate's office hours).

Nate serves as both customer and manager (though possibly a bad manager). When you have a meeting, you are allowed to ask the Nate to serve any of these roles, or even to switch roles during the meeting. As customer, Nate can help you to determine what a reasonable set of requirements are, and whether your documents and prototypes are compelling. As manager, Nate can help you to resolve conflicts or give suggestions about designs, teamwork, and tools. Don't forget or underuse either of these roles.

It is a bad idea to try to hide information from your customer. If things are going poorly or you are having trouble, be upfront. You may get good suggestions, and the customer won't feel blindsided if you are unable to resolve the problems on your own. It is a doubly bad idea to try to hide problems or conflicts from your manager. Instead, use your manager (Nate) as a resource to help solve those issues.
