# Agenda

**Goals:**
- Schedule regular meetings for collaboration.
- Refine the back-end architecture with a focus on database design and API structure.
- Get initial home page setup for testing.

**Progress Report:**
- Decided to move forward with using the OpenRouteService API to calculate the actual beer crawl routes.
- Explored how the API works and its capabilities in route optimization.
- We are deciding how to balance using both APIs (Google Maps and OpenRouteService) efficiently. Google Maps helps us find bars and ORS calculates the best routes between them.

**Plans for next week:**
- Continue working on integrating ORS API with the backend for route calculation.
- Begin integrating Google Maps API for bar location retrieval.
- Coordinate with the front-end to start drafting out the UI.
