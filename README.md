# Course project: Requirements & Team Policies

## Overview
Establish a solid definition of your project from which to base a design and implementation. You will
write a document that describes the goals of your project, its functional and non-functional requirements,
and the processes your team will follow to implement it. This is the first iteration of a living document,
and you’ll be asked to update it during the development cycle.
## Setup
Work with your newly-assigned project teams.
Create a shared living document. (We recommend a Google doc, or a Markdown or LaTex document
in a shared repository.) The majority of your technical writing will go in to this document, and when a
milestone is due you will make a snapshot (PDF) of this document and upload to Canvas.
## Instructions
Produce the first version of your living document with the following sections.
<ol>
  <li>Team info & policies (10%)</li>
  Provide a concise summary of the project team and project artifacts. Specifically:
  - List each team member and their role in the project.
  - Link to each project relevant artifact such as your git repo (this can be empty for now).
  - List communication channels/tools with corresponding use/communication policies (check main
  course page for communication channels and policies.)
  <li>Product description (20%)</li>
  Use the product description of the project proposal as a starting point. Revise it based on feedback you
  received so far, and incorporate it into this section. Additionally, add the following to this section:
  - 4+ major features you will implement.
  - 2+ stretch goals you hope to implement.
  The major features should constitute a minimal viable product (MVP).
  <li>Use Cases (Functional Requirements) (30%)</li>
  Each team member must come up with and describe at least one use case of your product, following
  this template:
  <ol>
    <li>Actors</li>
    <li>Triggers</li>
    <li>Preconditions (success scenario)</li>
    <li>Postconditions (success scenario)</li>
    <li>List of steps</li>
    <li>Extensions/variations of the success scenario</li>
    <li>Exceptions: failure conditions and scenarios</li>
    <li>(At the end of this step you will have at least one use case per team member.)</li>
  </ol>
  <li>Non-functional Requirements (10%)</li>
  Describe at least three non-functional requirements, e.g., related to scalability, usability, security and
  privacy, etc.
  
  <li>External Requirements (10%)</li>
  In addition to the requirements stated above, the Nate imposes the following requirements on your
  product:
  - The product must be robust against errors that can reasonably be expected to occur, such as invalid
  user input.
  - The product must be installable by a user, or if the product is a web-based service, the server must
  have a public URL that others can use to access it. If the product is a stand-alone application, you
  are expected to provide a reasonable means for others to easily download, install, and run it.
  - The software (all parts, including clients and servers) should be buildable from source by others. If
  your project is a web-based server, you will need to provide instructions for someone else setting up a
  new server. Your system should be well documented to enable new developers to make enhancements.
  - The scope of the project must match the resources (number of team members) assigned.
  Make sure that these requirements, if applicable to your product, are specialized to your project and
  included in your document—do not copy and paste these requirements verbatim. You may leave this as a
  separate section or fold its items into the other requirements sections.
  <li>6. Team process description (20%)</li>
  Describe your semeseter-long development process.
  - Specify and justify the software toolset you will use.
  - Define and justify each team member’s role: why does your team need this role filled, and why is
  a specific team member suited for this role?
  - Provide a schedule for each member (or sub-group) with at least four concrete milestones and
  deadlines for the semester.
  - Specify and explain at least three major risks that could prevent you from completing your project.
  - Describe at what point in your process external feedback (i.e., feedback from outside your project
  group, including the project manager) will be most useful and how you will get that feedback.
  Export a PDF snapshot of your document named PorjectName-m2.pdf and submit it to Canvas by due
  date EOD (Check Calendar).

## Clarifications and FAQs

How much should we say about the software toolset we will use? What programming languages,
data sources, project trackers, and other tools will you use? What, if any, software components will you
attempt to use ”off the shelf” versus implementing them from scratch? Explain why you chose these tools
and languages, as well as why they are suitable for your project.
It is OK to establish some of the answers during the requirements engineering stage and others during
the design stage. It is also OK of some of these change as you continue working on the project.

What is a team member ”role”? A role describes the part of the project (or a set of tasks) a team
member is responsible for. You can refine these roles as you continue to work on your project and you are
free to change them as you go forward. It is important, however, to justify your current decisions.

Here are two examples for defining roles:
1. A typical web application project could have roles of: 2-3 backend engineers, 1-2 frontend engineers,
and 1-2 engineers in charge of UI design (probably in addition to being frontend or backend engineers).
2. A data analysis project could have roles of: 1-2 people responsible for data collection and storage, 1-2
people responsible for data analysis and visualization, and 1-2 people responsible for infrastructure and
automation.
## Any advice regarding writing?
Plausibility, thoughtfulness, and level of detail will largely determine the score for this assignment. For
example, generic or incomplete use cases often lead to deductions. You should choose and clearly describe
substantial use cases that are important to the core functionality of your product. You should also list a
reasonable set of steps in the various scenarios that can occur in these use cases. Make sure to not omit
important steps or details. Make sure that the state of the system at the end of any path through the use
case matches what the use case claimed is the final state.
Your documents must be clear and professional. This means they should be concisely written, with
proper spelling and grammar, clear wording, and formatted with supporting structure to present your
ideas clearly to the reader.
You are developing a living document, which means you should expect change requests and iterations.
### Is there a minimum or maximum number of pages?
No, grading focuses on completeness and proper writing (clarity and conciseness). As with all writing,
technical or otherwise, you want to completely address each thing that needs to be addressed (in this case,
requirements) while expressing it concisely and clearly enough to be understandable and largely free of
redundancy.
